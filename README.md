Here I keep some small notebooks for some little questions I investigate.

It contains so far:
* [Correcting the intuition with regards to breaking distance and car speed](2020Breaking_distance/collision.ipynb)
* [Visualizing the Transit times to Amsterdam Central](2020AMS_OV_Distance/visualization.ipynb)
